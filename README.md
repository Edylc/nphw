# NPHW

Project created for Independent Studies Computer Science class, 2016-2017, at NPHS.  Meant to be a homework compilation site where teachers can post homework and students can see all their assignments in one place.  Fully functional, although never adopted; available at [nphw.herokuapp.com](https://nphw.herokuapp.com).  This repository includes code for the front-end website as well as the API.
