# nphw

Project created for Independent Studies Computer Science class, 2016-2017, at NPHS.  Meant to be a homework compilation site where teachers can post homework and students can see all their assignments in one place.  Fully functional, although never adopted; available at [nphw.herokuapp.com](nphw.herokuapp.com).
